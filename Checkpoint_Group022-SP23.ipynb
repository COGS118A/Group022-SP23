    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to identify whether a person with specific metrics will make more or less than $50,000 a year. The data used will be a kaggle dataset showing features that contribute to an individuals income. This would include features such as gender, race, occupation, and all the information would have to classify you. There are certain features that don't have numerical values such as race or occupation so we can one hot encode those features. With this data, we will perform some exploratory data analysis on these features and see if there are biases that we can exclude such as a feature that measures higher education.  Once all of that is done, we will used our clean dataset to classify people who make more or less than 50,000 annually.Performance of a model is measured by accuracy and f1-score."

    "\n",
    "According to the United States government <a name=\"incomeImportance\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#importance-income), accurate survey data about income is hard to come by. There's plenty of issues in reporting data such as difficulty in understanding income questions, different interpretations of income questions, and other factors that make income reporting not as reliable as one might think. Having accurate income data is important as income data is an important metric in determining health related quality of life<a name=\"incomeHealth\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#health-income). Furthermore, a person reaches about $50k, they can be classified as middle class.<a name=\"midIncome\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#mid-income)."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a set of initial circumstances (age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain/loss, native country), does a person make at least or less than $50k a year? To answer such a question, we can develop a ML model takes in the circumstances as input and produce a binary classification based on the data. To make sure our results are replicable by clearly documenting our steps. To make the problem measurable, we decided to use accuracy and F1-score as performance metrics. Accuracy tells us how the ratio of correct predictions over total predictions. In case the data is imbalanced, we use F1-score to get a more balanced result."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are trying to classify whether a participant has an income >= 50k or < 50k, we can use a logistic regression or SVM classifier using different regularization strengths. Both classifiers give the probabilities of data points belonging to a binary classification. A solution can be tested by using train-test splits and comparing it to other test sets. We chose logistic regression because it provides probability based outcomes and is a computationally simple algorithm that is robust to noise. Similarly, SVM can avoid overfitting via regularization and can help the model deal with issues that arises from dealing with higher dimensional data. "

    "\n",
    "One evaluation metric we can use is accuracy. As we are making binary decisions, we want to know if our model is making the correct decisions for the data points its given. We can set up a good k-folds cross validation to reduce bias in the data and also look at the f1 score to measure the accuracy and quantify it. With our k-folds cross validation, we can split up the data into k-folds which allows the model to be more versatile when it comes to newer data. In this case, it would give us more accurate results when it comes to newer data."

Further, the classification of >=50k and <50k does not expose information about what a participant's actual income is. There is potential for bias in this dataset, as certain areas of the US are known to be more/less wealthy, and there is no mention of where (besides it being in the US) the data is collected. Changing variables such as education level into one-hot encodings also removes the underlying biases between higher education and income."
